## PSQL QUESTION ANSWERING
I created some tasks and used SQL syntax for solving them

I used pgAdmin4 for manipulating SQL commands


## PYTHON 3.12.0 FOR CREATING A CONNECTION BETWEEN DATASET AND PSQL
I used Python 3.12.0 (you can use ver. 3.10 or older) for creating a connection between the dataset and PSQL

You need to install «pandas» and «SQLalchemy» libraries for the program to work
