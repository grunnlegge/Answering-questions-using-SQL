## PSQL QUESTION ANSWERING
I created some tasks and used SQL syntax for solving them

I used pgAdmin4 for manipulating SQL commands


## PYTHON 3.12.0 FOR CREATING A CONNECTION BETWEEN DATASET AND PSQL
I used Python 3.12.0 (you can use ver. 3.10 or higher) for creating a connection between the dataset and PSQL

You need to install «pandas» and «SQLalchemy» libraries for the program to work

In the «SQL_connection» file in line 4 you need to point your PSQL username and a password that you used when you created a PSQL table

In the same file in line 11 you need to point YOUR folder path WHERE your dataset is stored dataset
