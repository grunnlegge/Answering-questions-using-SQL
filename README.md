You need to install «pandas» and «SQLalchemy» libraries for the program to work

In the «SQL_connection» file in line 4 you need to point your PSQL username and a password that you used when you created a PSQL table

In the same file in line 11 you need to point YOUR folder path WHERE your dataset is stored dataset
